Custom Rules for the SharePoint Code Analysis Framework (SPCAF)
===============================================================

Summary
-------
This project contains custom community rules that can be used with the [SharePoint Code Analysis Framework (SPCAF)](http://www.spcaf.com). 

The purpose of this project is to align the coding practices checked by SPCAF with the guidance defined by Microsoft e.g. in the [Office Patterns and Practices](https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP) project in order to support developers with the transformation of their legacy full trust farm solutions (.wsp) to the SharePoint App model.
                                     
What is SPCAF?
--------------
The SharePoint Code Analysis Framework (SPCAF) analyzes the code SharePoint solutions (.wsp) for SharePoint 2007 / 2010 / 2013
SharePoint 2013/Online apps

SPCAF includes five different analysis components for 

* Code Quality Analysis, 
* Metrics, 
* Dependency Analysis, 
* Inventory and 
* Code Migration Assessment.
 
SPCAF runs integrated in Visual Studio 2010, 2012 and 2013 or in the standalone client application that can analyze without having the source code.
Further, with SPCAF Server you can integrate the code analysis into your continuous integration process in Team Foundation Server, Visual Studio Online, TeamCity or any other automated build system.
