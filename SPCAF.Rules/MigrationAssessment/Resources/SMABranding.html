            <b>Branding</b>
            <p>
                Branding is the term to describe visual customisation to SharePoint, to show company colours, logos, and custom layouts.

            <b>Remote Provisioning Model</b>
            <p>
                Remote Provisioning allows us to brand SharePoint sites in much the same way as before, except with improved usability.
                The Client Side Scripting approach allows us to address the user during the branding process, informing them of the upgrade status.

            <b>Dependency on Deployed Files</b>
            <p>
                When you create a an element in SharePoint from a Declarative file, the content you have created is then dependent on the xml files they are described in.
                When these need to be retracted, due to an update, a change in the system, or part of a disaster recovery plan, this link is broken.
                This will ultimately cause issues in the long run.

            <b>Cloud Application Model</b>
            <p>
                The Cloud Application Model or CAM, is designed to create content through code, therefore not creating any sort of dependency links.
            </p>

            <b>Easier Backup/Restore</b>
            <p>
                The backup/restore of a site is independent from deployed WSP solutions which reduced the complexity of a backup/restore process.
