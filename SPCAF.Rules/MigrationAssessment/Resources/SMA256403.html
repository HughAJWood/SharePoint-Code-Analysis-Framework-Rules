            <b>XSLT</b>
            <p>
                XSLT is a language designed to transform structured data from one layout to another.
                In SharePoint this is often used to change the way a WebPart displays information from a list or a search result.

            <b>Client Side Rendering</b>
            <p>
                The way the field type is altered from a basic field type in the new model is through Client Side Rendering (CSR).
                Including a JSLink file and adding it to the view allows the developer to modify the view in any way they desire.

            <p>

            <b>Client Side Rendering Benefits</b>
            <p>
                CSR moved processing from the server to the client further reducing server load when displaying a page, and making pages load faster in general.
                For developers, JSLink came from the need to simplify the way client side rendering was done, in order to reduce complication.
