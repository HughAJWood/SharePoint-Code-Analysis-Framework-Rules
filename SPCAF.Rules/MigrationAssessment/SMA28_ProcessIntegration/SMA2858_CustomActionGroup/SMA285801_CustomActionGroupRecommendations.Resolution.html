            <b>Custom Action</b>
            <p>
                Custom actions are a flexible way of adding, or taking away, functionality from declarative elements of the page.
                Typical usages of a custom action are to hide Ribbon buttons, include JavaScript into an existing master page, remove access to elements for non Administrators or to link new functionality to the UI.
            </p>
            <b>Custom Action Group</b>
            <p>
                A Custom Action Group is a Full Trust only solution to allow you to group Custom Actions together under a single ID.

            <p>
                The Schema for the App Model is limited, allowing only new UI links.
                This is limited on purpose for security reasons.
                For these security reasons, you are unable to ScriptLink, Hide Elements, Create Command UI Handlers, or create Custom Action Groups with this schema.

            <b>Dependency on Deployed Files</b>
            <p>
                When you create a an element in SharePoint from a Declarative file, the content you have created is then dependent on the XML files they are described in.
                When these need to be retracted, due to an update, a change in the system, or part of a disaster recovery plan, this link is broken.
                This will ultimately cause issues in the long run.
