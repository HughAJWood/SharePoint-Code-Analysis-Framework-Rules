            <b>Fields</b>
            <p>
                A field is the XML definition of a Site Column, used in Content Types, and Lists to provide an input field of the desired type.
            </p>

            <b>Paradigm Shift - Deployment through Code</b>
            <p>
                An alternate method is the creation of Fields through code.
                This method takes the structure of a list, and creates the Fields, Content Type, and Lists  programmatically.
                While also popular in Full-Trust solutions, it is the preferred method through the App Model, doing the same provisioning process remotely.
            </p>
            <b>Client Side Rendering</b>
            <p>
                The way the Field Type is altered from a basic field type with the new model is through Client Side Rendering (CSR).
                Including a JSLink file and adding it to the view allows the developer to modify the view in any way they desire.
            </p>
            <b>Pre-migration</b>
            <p>
                Due to the way CSR works with JSLink, old Field Types need to be reverted to their parent FieldTypes pre-migration.
                This will then make them a) Compatible with the Migration and b) Ready to take a JSLink file to display the field as desired.

            <b>Dependency on Deployed Files</b>
            <p>
                When you create a an element in SharePoint from a Declarative file, the content you have created is then dependent on the xml files they are described in.
                When these need to be retracted, due to an update, a change in the system, or part of a disaster recovery plan, this link is broken.
                This will ultimately cause issues in the long run.

            <b>Cloud Application Model</b>
            <p>
                The Cloud Application Model or CAM, is designed to create content through code, therefore not creating any sort of dependency links.
