            <b>HttpModule</b>
            <p>
                A HttpModule is a Full Trust interface which intercepts requests to the server and allows for processing before anything else.
                Typical usages are custom authentication, and redirects.

            <b>SharePoint Claims Authentication</b>
            <p>
                Claims Authentication, allows you to use a custom authentication provider in order to provide custom security.
                While HttpModules have been used for this in the past, only Claims Authentication should be used.
            </p>
            <b>Redirects, and other uses of HttpModules</b>
            <p>
                Some usages in the past of a HttpModule are no longer valid.
                However some usages like redirections, do have work arounds still available with the newer model, using client side scripting.
                With the usages too varied, each particular case needs to be identified and remapped into the newer Client Side Object Model.

            <b>Case by Case</b>
            <p>
                There being so many usages of a HttpModule (the most common being authentication and redirects), we can provide better alternatives with other Out of the Box functionality.
                While Claims Authentication was not available early on, it is now fully integrated into SharePoint meaning the process of configuring it is straight forward.
                In these cases Client Side Scripting is a better option for handling Redirects, keeping usability in mind.
