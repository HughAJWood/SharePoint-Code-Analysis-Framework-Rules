            <b>List Definition</b>
            <p>
                A List definition is the Schema for a SharePoint List. A List definition contains <i>Schema.xml</i> which contains the information relating to the columns, content types, views, and forms.

            <b>Paradigm Shift - Deployment through Code</b>
            <p>
                The alternate method is to deploy the List through code.
                This methodology takes the structure of a List and each component of the List, then creates these elements through Managed Code.
                While also popular in Full-Trust solutions, it is the preferred method through the App Model, doing the same provisioning process remotely.

            <b>Dependency on Deployed Files</b>
            <p>
                When you create an element in SharePoint from a Declarative file, the content you have created is then dependent on the XML files they are described in.
                When these need to be retracted, due to an update, a change in the system, or part of a disaster recovery plan, this link is broken.
                This will ultimately cause issues in the long run.

            <b>Cloud Application Model</b>
            <p>
                The Cloud Application Model or CAM, is designed to create content through code, therefore not creating any sort of dependency links.
