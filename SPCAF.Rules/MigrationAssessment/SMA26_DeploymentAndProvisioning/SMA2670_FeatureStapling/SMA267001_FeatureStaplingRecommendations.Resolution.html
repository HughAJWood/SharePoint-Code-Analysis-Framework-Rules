            <b>Enforcing Functionality during Creation of New Sites/SubSites</b>
            <p>
                Feature Stapling allows you to declaratively link Features with the creation of new Sites/Subsites which use a certain template on creation.
                This allows you to easily add extra functionality even to Out of the Box Site Templates, as well as custom Site Templates

            <p>
                The product catalog can be configured to always include an app with a new site created from a template.
                While we won't have feature stapling directly in the App Model, App stapling allows you to simulate this process and provide almost identical features, which ties in with
                Remote Provisioning models of the SharePoint 2013 App Model.

            <b>Not migratable to App Model</b>
            <p>
                A rethink of the design and structure of the Feature Stapling will have to take place.
                There is no direct mapping to a feature stapling in the App Model. While work arounds are possible.
            </p>
            <b>Cannot garentuee order of stapling</b>
            <p>
                This is a common issue with Feature stapling in SharePoint, sometimes very complex work arounds are required, in order to acheive what should be an easy change to the site.
                This results in unpredictability and poor governance.
            </p>
            <b>Hides the processing from the end user</b>
            <p>
                When using this technique traditionally, you will get the normal please wait feedback, with no information.
                This can be troublesome with Feature Stapling, due to it often increasing the provisioning time of a site creation.
            </p>

            <b>Better usability, and user feedback</b>
            <p>
                The App Model helps push things to the presentation layer. This in turn allows you to keep the users aprised of why any processing may be taking longer than expected.
            </p>
            <b>Seperation of roles</b>
            <p>
                The provisioning engine can be hosted away from the SharePoint farm, this increases many factors, including performance and disaster recovery.
                Allowing for faster spin ups after a disaster recovery action, or on initial provisioning.
