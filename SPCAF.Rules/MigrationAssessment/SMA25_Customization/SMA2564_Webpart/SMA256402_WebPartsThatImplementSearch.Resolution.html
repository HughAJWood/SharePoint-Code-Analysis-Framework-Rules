            <p>
                The use of the Search API in code has for some time helped developers use the power of the Search Features in their webparts to display the required data.
                This helps increase the performance of older SharePoint platforms.

            <p>
                Search now drives most of what you see and work with in SharePoint 2013.
                New WebParts have been included Out of the Box for displaying search results. When combined with JSLink they become an powerful resource for displaying information across the SharePoint Farm.

                Previously, to access the Search API through code was necessary. This has now been addressed and replaced with Out of the Box WebParts.

                Search Results and Content Query WebParts provide 99% of use cases of wanting to display data.
                If you require a more complex component, then the search api is fully functional in the App Model.
